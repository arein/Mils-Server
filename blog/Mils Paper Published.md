Mils was developed in a project study at the Technical University of Munich. We first had another ida, "Train Claim", which was a smartphone app that facilitated the process of claiming refunds in the case of train delays.

Here's the pitch of the paper:
In an interdisciplinary project study at TUM Ferdinand Ehrhardt and I were challenged to investigate the process of launching an app.

Prior to working on Mils Ferdinand and I carried out work on our idea Train Claim, a smartphone app that facilitates the process of claiming refunds in the case of train delays.
The idea was based on the EU Directive on Passengers Rights that obliges railway companies to refund certain amounts of the ticket price in the case of delays.
Although we liked the idea a lot we dumped it for the reasons outlined in the presentation.

While working on Train Claim we discovered the necessity for an easy to use, pay-as-you go snail mail app that allows you to add your handwritten signature to your letters.

That's exactly what Mils is. Have fun with the presentation. As always, feedback is appreciated ;)
