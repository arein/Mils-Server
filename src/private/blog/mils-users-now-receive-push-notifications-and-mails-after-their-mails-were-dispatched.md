We're proud to announce that Mils now notifies you after your letters have
been dispatched.

You will then receive __both an email and a Push Notification__.

This makes the experience of dispatching pdf files as real letters even
more convenierent.

*If you have further ideas what could be done please don't hesitate to
comment.* ;)
