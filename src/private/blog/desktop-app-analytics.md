Having created several apps before, we've grown to be super huge fans of __app analytics__. There are several great tools out there for __mobile__ app analytics.
Obviously, we were expecting a similar analytics ecosystem on the desktop.

However, we had to find out that in fact most of the top notch mobile app analytics companies do __not__ offer desktop sdks such as Flurry or Localytics.
 
There seems to be at least one good alternative for the desktop: [__Deskmetrics__](http://deskmetrics.com). However, their pricing model starts with $100 per month which we consider too expensive.

Therefore, we ended up using [__Tapstream__](https://tapstream.com) which actually targets advertisement evaluation but helps us with analytic as well.

One great thing about Tapstream is that they support both, Mac OS X and Windows 8 apps. Hence, they meet our platform requirements.

Additionally, Tapstream allows us to find out about the quality of our Ad campaigns (i.e. how many installs per $ spent on a campaign).

Feel free to leave a comment and to tell us what your experience with Desktop analytics is.
