The default for geocoding on Windows 8 is Bing Maps. Unfortunately, Bing Maps requires the geocoding query to be in the user's language language. Moreover, mixing languages within a query is not supported.

This did not meet our requirements as a German user might query something like "MÃ¼nchen, Germany".

Therefore, we created a Google Geocoding Client for Windows 8.

The client is hosted on Github and can be imported via [nuget](https://github.com/arein/GoogleGeocodingAPI).
