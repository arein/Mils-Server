Mils today announces the launch of its free Mac OS X and Windows 8 apps, which consitute the hipster way of sending traditional mail from your computer. Mils revolutionizes traditional postal services by solving two intrinsic problems:
1) Antiquate the necessity to print, envelope, stamp, and dispatch letters
2) Accelerate the time required for the letter to reach its destination, especially with international mail

Mils tight integration into operating systems enables users not only to send pdf files but also to conveniently dispatch letters from within any app that supports printing (i.e. Microsoft Office). A map inside Mils shows you for each letter letter where the letter would be printed, which courier would deliver the letter, and how far the printing site is from the recipient.

A key feature is Mils global distribution network incorporating more then 23 printing sites in 23 countries which enables super fast deliveries on an international scale.

The ability to add your handwritten signature just by signing on the screen of either an Android, iOS, or Windows Phone device is really crucial as it abolishes the need to print and sign the letter.

Speaking on the announcement, Mils CTO Alexander-Derek Rein commented: "Mils is to postal services what Whatsapp was to text messages. It disrupts a whole industry as turns sending letters from a time intensive, nerve wrecking experience into a fast and digital phenomenon. We are excited to turn this technology into an opportune moment which holds the prospect of facilitating the lives of thousands, and hopefully millions of people worldwide. One letter at a time."
